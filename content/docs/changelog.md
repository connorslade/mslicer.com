## v0.6.0 &mdash; March 23rd, 2026

- New logo/icon (gnome inspired)
- Better packaging for MacOS (.app bundle) and Windows (.rc file)
- Keyboard shortcuts use ⌘ on MacOS
- Fix panic caused by race condition
- Show annotated layers on slice preview slider
- Show project file name in window title
- Cleanup slice preview scaling
  - Will now always default to 1× scale
  - Zooming is now centered on the cursor position
- Cleanup model panel UI
- Remove accidental doc-tests in [stl.rs](https://github.com/connorslade/mslicer/blob/main/format/mesh_format/src/stl.rs), which blocking nixpkgs-update build
- Make slices at middle of layer height (not bottom)
- Fix volume stored in .nanodlp files
- Add exposure PWM control to slice config ([#21](https://github.com/connorslade/mslicer/issues/21))
- Fix layers rendering flipped in slice preview  ([#20](https://github.com/connorslade/mslicer/issues/20))
- Use standard unit (mm/min) for lift/retract speeds and slice height ([#22](https://github.com/connorslade/mslicer/issues/22))
- Replace about panel with a first time popup that links to the documentation
- Show individual model volume (before slicing)
- Model specific relative exposures ([#18](https://github.com/connorslade/mslicer/pull/18))
- Correctly overwrite render settings when generating preview images
  - Will now use rendered mode without overhang detection, the default fov, and the correct aspect ratio
- Pick between Perspective or Orthographic camera projections
- Camera pitch is no longer locked between (-90°, 90°)
- Exposure test generator ([#24](https://github.com/connorslade/mslicer/pull/24))
- Button to create new project
- Fix numerical precision issues introduced when converting units
- Replace tasks panel with top bar widget

  - Basic (unfinished) manually placed support routing
- Use async tasks for more operations
  - Loading meshes
  - Saving and loading projects
  - Building acceleration structures
  - File pick/save dialogs
  - Exporting sliced files (mostly needed for compressing .nanodlp)
- Color backfaces grey in rendered view
- Don't show multiple copies of layer in slice preview when panning far to the right
- Printer presets (print volume, resolution)
- Reduce memory usage of loaded models
- Reuse GPU buffers when possible (instead of reallocating)
- Don't duplicate mesh data in project save file
- Custom project and mesh (de)serialization with progress monitoring
- Added task panel to view the progress of running async tasks
- Run post processing operations asynchronously with their own progress bars
- Added support for the NanoDLP format (.nanodlp)
- Allow setting/updating default slice config ([#5](https://github.com/connorslade/mslicer/issues/5))
- Remember the file that was opened for future save operations
- Track changes to settings for undo and redo (under edit in the top bar)
- Use metric prefixes for slice config draggers
- Allow using any supported output format with the CLI slicer
- More robust slicing (include scanline boundary hits)
- Show resin volume usage and estimated print time under slice preview
- Island detection task
- Fix invalid unit and color space transformations with type safe systems
- Use the 'windows' subsystem on Windows

- Generated meshes (supports) now have correct normals and face winding order

## v0.2.2 &mdash; June 14th, 2025

- Clamp grid size
- Fix intermittent crash due to mismatched texture formats between egui and renderer pipelines

## v0.2.1 &mdash; April 13, 2025

- Don't produce invalid results when models extend beyond build volume
- Made the slicer system usable as a standalone CLI application

## v0.2.0 &mdash; Feb 19, 2025

- Render parts of models that go beyond the print volume red
- Remove the Stats panel and merge it into the Workspace panel
- Add documentation into the About panel

- Persist panel layout between sessions. I also added a button to reset the UI layout in the Workspace panel.

## v0.1.0 &mdash; Feb 12, 2025

First release!

I haven't really changed much in the past like six months, but now mslicer is on Flathub.
